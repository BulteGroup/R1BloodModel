## Abstract

Under normal physiological conditions, the R1 in blood is influenced by many factors, including haematocrit, field strength, temperature, protein concentrations, and the weak paramagnetic effects of deoxyhaemoglobin and dissolved oxygen. In addition, techniques such as oxygen-enhanced MRI require high fractions of inspired oxygen to induce hyperoxia, which complicates the R1 signal further. Whilst a linear increase in R1 with oxygen partial pressure has been reported in phantoms, measurements in blood have produced contradictory effects. A quantitative model relating total blood oxygen content to R1 could help explain these contradictory effects. 
 
Existing models for blood R1 can account for SO<sub>2</sub>, haematocrit, and magnetic field strength (B0), but are not applicable under conditions of artificially increased PO<sub>2</sub>, or hyperoxic experiments. Therefore, we present a general model to estimate the R1 of blood, accounting for haematocrit, SO<sub>2</sub>, PO<sub>2</sub>, and B0 under both normal physiological and normobaric hyperoxic conditions.

As a future direction of this work, we have hosted the open-source model code and a current list of blood R1 measurements here on GitHub and invite the MRI community to share new blood R1 measurement results and refit the model to improve accuracy. Such a project would greatly improve this model as T1, Hct, SO<sub>2</sub> and PO<sub>2</sub> measurement methods continue to improve in accuracy over the years to come.
